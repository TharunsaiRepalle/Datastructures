# Datastructures
This Repository is to solve/pratice all Datastructrues and Algorithms using Nodejs and Go

# What is Datastructure?
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Remember that each data has its own trade-offs. And you need to pay attention more to why you're choosing a certain data structure than to how to implement it.

# What is Algorithm?
An Alogrithm is set of instructions that tells a computer how to do something or you can also say set by step solution of the problem.
