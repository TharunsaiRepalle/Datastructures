# What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows.

# O(n) - Linear Time Complexity. 

    Signifies that the execution time of the algorithm grows linearly in proportion to the size of the input data(n).

    In simple terms As the no of items in the input data increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run increases correspondingly.

    Eg: Image you have a box of 5 items and want to find a specific item in the box. Time taken to find the item inside the box grows as the
    items inside the box increases.

# O(1) -  Constant Time Complexity.

    O(1) aks constant time, signifies that the execution time of an algorithm remains constant regardless of the input size.

    Eg: Image you have a box of items and you want to find the item in the box and you know where to search it then it is 0(1).

# O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity.

    Indicates that the algorithm's execution time grows quadratically with the size of the input data (represented by n).

    Eg: Image you have a box of items and want to compare each item with every other item to find specific pairs. As the number of items(n) increases,The number of comaparsions(n^2) grows much faster.

# O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity.

    0(log n) time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime that grows logarithmically with the size of the input (represented by n).In simpler terms, as the input size increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run increases slowly.

    Eg: Image a box of items and you want to search specific item in the box then the time taken to search the item increase logarithmically as the items inside the box increases.
