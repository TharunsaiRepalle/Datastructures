An array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored contiguously in memory. Each element can be accessed using its index, an integer value representing its position in the array.

eg: [1,2,3,4,5] -> array elements
     0,1,2,3,4  -> array indexes


Operations:
  Accessing an element : O(1)
  Inserting an element : O(n)
  Deleting an element  : O(n)

Time complexity analysis:
  Accessing an element : O(1)
  Inserting an element : O(n)
  Deleting an element  : O(n)
